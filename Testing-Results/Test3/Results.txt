1. I realized I had a major issue with my data filtering. I was filtering the possible players to train the model on, by those who had an mip share of over 0 that year
(instead of by the minimum requirements met) OR having an MIP share of over 0. Also, I changed to filter out the ones with MIP share less than 0.04, as those with a lesser
score than that never had much of a chance to win the award and shouldn't be accounted for in the training.

2. I noticed KD got guessed a lot by the models in 2009-10, even though he got low votes for the actual award. Looks to me because he was already very good as a player
3. Also, strange case of Channing Frye in same year 2009-10.  He played a lot better than the year before, but actually not much better than his best season in the NBA. This needs 
to be accounted for in the future. Same with (Zach Randolph - 2010, )

4. Noticed Hakim Warrick got predicted in 2007, but had 0 votes for mip that year!!! He went from 4.1 PPG to 12.7PPG, a pretty large bump
    - Possibly because he only played 10.6 MPG the year before and bumped to 26.2 MPG, he wasn't watched much the year before.




things to Look at, what #year in the league it was for candidates, maybe compare current season to 2 years ago, or to their worst season.
