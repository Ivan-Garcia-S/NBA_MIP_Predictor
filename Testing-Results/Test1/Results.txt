1. I noticed that my MIP Share values for the top MIP candidates were a lot lower than the actual values. Also that usually at around the top 12th candidate each season, their share was 0 or close to 0.
My models were predicting values of around 0.1 around the 12th candidate area, which makes me believe the MIP share was being too evenly distributed among too many players,
and needs to be more harsh on less likely candidates.

2. I noticed candidates that had already won the award (Paul George in 2012-13) were getting high shares in other years where they made big leaps (2017-18 to 2018-19). Since a player has never won MIP 
twice before I need to account for that in my data filtering.
